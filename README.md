homeowork 1, create logistic regression based on the data set provided. Don't use classifier from package.
# TODO
- Roll back to previous version for regression if needed
- Keep cross validation function. 
- Check if standardization function is messing things up. 
- Multiclass Regression keep trying. (Maybe no standardization.)
